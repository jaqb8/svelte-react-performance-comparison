# Comparative performance analysis of frontend frameworks based on Svelte and React

This repository contains the source code for a Master's thesis project that compares the performance of frontend frameworks based on Svelte and React. The project includes two simple single-page applications (SPA) - one built with Svelte and the other with React.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze and compare the performance of Svelte and React, two popular frontend frameworks, in terms of various performance metrics such as load time, time to interactive, and memory usage. The project includes two identical single-page applications built with Svelte and React respectively, and various performance tests are conducted on both apps.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Svelte
- React
- Vite
- Playwright

## Results

The results of the performance tests are presented and analyzed in the master thesis report. The report includes detailed descriptions of the test scenarios, the results of the tests, and a comparative analysis of the performance of Svelte and React. The report is available in the docs folder of this repository.

## Conclusion

The project provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Svelte and React, and can be useful for frontend developers and researchers who are interested in comparing the performance of these two frameworks. The project can also be extended to include other frontend frameworks and additional performance tests.
